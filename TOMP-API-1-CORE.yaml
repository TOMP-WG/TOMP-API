        * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate reference system is
        WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84)
        unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

        If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system is WGS 84
        longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)
        unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

        The query parameter `bbox-crs` is specified in OGC API - Features - Part 2: Coordinate
        Reference Systems by Reference.

        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
        minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
        However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
        (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
        the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
        server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant geometries.
