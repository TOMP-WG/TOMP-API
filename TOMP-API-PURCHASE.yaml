      description: -|
        ALL required details MUST be added to the offer (using the pre-sales module) before purchasing the offer.<br>

        _PURCHASE_ - purchase an offered package<br>
        _2_PHASE_PURCHASE_ - transactional purchase, requires COMMIT to confirm the purchase.<br>
        _COMMIT_ - confirm the transactional (2-phase) purchase<br>
        _RELEASE_ - release the offer, remove claims on resources<br>

        The request COULD return a 202, making this an a-synchronous process.
