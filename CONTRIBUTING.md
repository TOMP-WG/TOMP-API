## How to contribute to the TOMP-API

#### **Did you find a bug?** 👾

* 🔍 **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/TOMP-WG/TOMP-API/issues).

* 😒 If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/TOMP-WG/TOMP-API/issues/new). Be sure to complete the template, include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and the expected behavior that is not occurring.
  Please, if it's possible, also include who is the MP and who is the TO (or TOs).

* 📨 You'll be contacted soon (when we know your email address), or you will receive an email from github from Working Team 1 (WT1), possibly asking for more context or clarification.

* 🗳️ Currently, there is no voting process, but there might be one later on.

* 👉 The issue will be assigned to a version (might be a patch, when required). You'll be notified when the issue is picked up by WT1, they will create a solution in a pull request.  
  **OR** you can create your own proposal and create a pull request, WT1 will assign a version later on and inform you.

* ❗ WT1 will create a PR (or possibly modify the existing one) for the issue. Once it's a PR, it can already be used in peer-2-peer solutions.
  
* 🤼 Please report the parties who have implemented it to test, so we can proof it's a confirmed working solution.

* When releasing a new version (or patch), you'll be notified that your issue is merged in the new version.

#### **Do you want to contribute?** 🦄

* Send an email to tomp-secretary@maas-alliance.eu, with the expertise you have (operating certain modes, specifying APIs, selling the idea of a common language for all), and we'll come back to you.

* Supporting the "House of TOMP" (the supporting AISBL, in formation)? Again, contact the tomp-secretary@maas-alliance.eu, until we'll have a registration page.

Thanks! 💕
