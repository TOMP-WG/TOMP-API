After the big Dragonfly 1.0.0 release, we have seen a lot of interest and got your feedback. That’s great, we love your feedback!  
And as feedback is made to act upon, we kept working and progressed into version 1.1.0.  

This is a minor release which is totally compatible with 1.0.0 (and 0.9.0), but adds nice features like:  

* alignment with GBFS 2.0
* support of an offboarding process
* first steps in supporting user groups
* improved support for  multi leg offers (user reference & leg sequence)
* added support for paging  

As the 1.1.0 release will be our last release of this year, think of it as our holiday gift to you. 2020 was kind of a bummer for a lot of us, but for the TOMP working group it was a great year!  

The first rides with TOMP-API communication were made and we saw a lot of adoption, inside and outside the Netherlands, e.g.:  

* Nazza
* Amber
* TanQYou
* GoAbout
* TaxiElectric
* Taxistop – eHUBS (BE) 
* FMS/AustraSoft (CH)
* Skedgo (AU)

We are really excited about what next year is gonna bring.

For now, happy newyear and stay safe.

Greetings,

TOMP Working Group
