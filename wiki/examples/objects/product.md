### Product statusses

The product statusses are not specified, but we have 2 'product' operations: 
* initiate, is a link that can be found on package level. When calling this operation, a new leg is made, in the status 'STARTED' and attached to the package.
* activate. Sometimes it is required to activate a product before it can be used. This link can also be found on the package level, and the package must also contain the product.
