# placeReference

this string references to information that can be found in the `data sources`. Enlist all prefixes (=rel) from the /collections/datasources/items that apply to a place/location. Default it matches already with 'GPS' (no entry required in the datasources). In case of a custom place (like home address), you can use the 'P:' prefix and add the address to the **places** list of the request/offer/package.

**Type:** `string`
