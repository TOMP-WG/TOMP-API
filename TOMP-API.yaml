        The list below contains all formalized operations. Other operations are allowed as well, but have one restriction - the external status of the leg cannot not be changed.<br>
        This allows for instance to introduce a 'OPEN_TRUNK' operation. The links collection can be altered depending on the operations that have been performed.<br>
        Communication from TO towards MP is handled in the 'notify' extension.<br>

        Operations:<br>
        _ASSIGN_ASSET_ [Prepurchase, trip execution] - can assign an ASSET to a LEG. Can be used to replace an ASSET, or as first step in the trip execution process [ONBOARDING STEP]<br>
        If assigning an ASSET is not allowed for this package 403 should be returned. If the package is unknown, 404 should be returned.<br>
        _CHANGE_END_TIME_ [Prepurchase, trip execution] will be used to request a changed end time; the TRAVELER wants to use the ASSET longer (or shorter), the **time** field contains the proposed end time, the end time of the package doesn't change<br>
        _CHANGE_START_TIME_ [Prepurchase, trip execution] will be used to request a changed start time, e.g. the TRAVELER wants to depart later, the **time** field contains the estimated start time, the start time of the package doesn't change<br>
        _CANCEL_ [Prepurchase, after sales] will cancel this LEG. Only allowed when multiple LEGs are included in the package, otherwise the complete package should be cancelled<br>
        _ADD_ANCILLARY_ [Prepurchase, trip execution] requests to add the specified ANCILLARY to the LEG<br>
        _REMOVE_ANCILLARY_ [Prepurchase, trip execution] requests to remove the specified ANCILLARY from the LEG<br>

        _PREPARE_ [MP->TO, non-TO-controlled] - MP request the TO to prepare the LEG (e.g. open the locker) [ONBOARDING STEP, RESUMING STEP]<br>
        If assigning an ASSET is not allowed for this package 403 should be returned. If the package is unknown, 404 should be returned.<br>
        _SET_IN_USE_ [MP->TO, non-TO-controlled] - will activate the LEG or resume the LEG [ONBOARDING STEP, RESUMING STEP]<br>
        _PAUSE_ [MP->TO] will pause the LEG [PAUSING STEP]<br>
        _START_FINISHING_ [MP->TO] will start the end-of-leg process [OFFBOARDING STEP]<br>
        _FINISH_ [MP->TO] will end this LEG [OFFBOARDING STEP]<br>
        _CANCEL_ [MP->TO] will cancel this LEG. Only allowed when multiple LEGs are included in the package, otherwise the complete package should be cancelled<br>

        _SEND_EVIDENCE_PARKED_ [MP->TO] sends pictures (in url field) to prove that the ASSET is parked correctly<br>
        _SEND_EVIDENCE_HELMET_ [MP->TO] sends pictures (in url field) to prove that the helmet is stowed correctly<br>
        _SEND_EVIDENCE_CHARGER_ [MP->TO] sends pictures (in url field) to prove that the ASSET connected correctly to the charger<br>

      in: query
      description: |-
        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected.
        The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on whether the
        coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or depth):

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate reference system is
        WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84)
        unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

        If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system is WGS 84
        longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)
        unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

        The query parameter `bbox-crs` is specified in OGC API - Features - Part 2: Coordinate
        Reference Systems by Reference.

        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
        minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
        However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
        (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
        the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
        server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant geometries.
