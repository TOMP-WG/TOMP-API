    description: gives information about transport asset availability and pricing [free_bike_status and system_pricing_plans in GBFS].<p> The endpoints in this part can give information about the availability of assets (or assetTypes) and can provide information to take the next step - the booking part.

  - name: booking
    description: a booking is the main object exchanged between MaaS and a TO [from MaaS-API]. <br>See also <a href='https://github.com/maasglobal/maas-tsp-api/blob/master/specs/Booking.md'>Booking.md</a><p>This section contains functionality to book a leg (part of a trip) for one asset (or assetType), including the non-happy paths (cancel, expire etc).

  - name: trip execution
    description: supports the complete trip execution process. It contains f.i. getting an available asset, assigning the asset to the leg, starting, pausing, finishing a leg (all by using the POST /legs/{id}/events) or updating an execution (not the state!).

    description: gives information about systems, stations, operating hours [from GBFS]

  - name: payment
    description: reports financial overview for legs

  - name: general
    description: general operations (e.g. notifications)

  - name: booking [optional]
    description: endpoints that can faciliate processes in the booking process, but are not necessary for a minimal viable product. You can think of getting information, updating (parts of) a booking (not the state!), adding and removing subscriptions (webhook), etc.

        <p>The Booking may be modified in the response, e.g. location being adjusted for a more suitable pick-up location.
        In addition, the service may contain a **meta** attribute for arbitrary TO metadata that the TO needs later, and **token** attribute depicting how long the current state is valid.
        <p> see (3.2) in the process flow - booking.
        <p>The MP can implement this endpoint when it allows direct booking by TOs. The specific TO can book an asset from themselves to get it registrated and handled (financially) by the MP.
