    description: supports the complete trip execution process. It contains f.i. getting an available asset, assigning the asset to the leg, starting, pausing, finishing a leg (all by using the POST /legs/{id}/events) or updating a leg (not the state!).

      description: This endpoint **must** be used to alter the state of a booking:<br>- The operation 'CANCEL' Cancels the booking (see <4> in the process flow - booking), <br>- the operation 'EXPIRE' informs that the booking-option is expired (seel <5> in the process flow - booking) and <br>- the 'COMMIT' actually makes this booking option a real confirmed booking. (see also (3.2) in process flow - booking). This event should also be used to commit in the 'postponed-commit' scenario.<br> - 'DENY' tells the MP that the leg is cancelled in the post-commit scenario. <p> `CANCEL` - Cancels a confirmed booking. Cancelling twice should still return 204. <br> `EXPIRE` - Typically for sending back a signal from TO to MP to tell the pending state is expired. Expiring twide should return 204. Expiring a booking in a non-pending state will result in 403. <BR> `COMMIT` - Turns the booking in a confirmed state, after all legs are in state pending. Committing twice will result in 204. If the booking is in state CANCELLED or EXPIRED, a commit will result a 403. <BR> `DENY` - Used for the 'postponed-commit' scenario. Whenever a TO cannot give garantees directly to fullfil a booking, it can return a 'COMMIT', but the state of the booking object should be 'POSTPONED-COMMIT'. In the conditions returned in the planning phase is stated until when this phase can be. After this time it will be come expired. Otherwise it can be commmitted when the leg is confirmed or denied (using this event).

      summary: informs customers about changes to the system outside of normal operations
      description: This feed is intended to inform customers about changes to the system that do not fall within the normal system operations. For example, system closures due to weather would be listed here, but a system that only operated for part of the year would have that schedule listed in the system-calendar.json feed. This file is an array of alert objects defined as below. Obsolete alerts should be removed so the client application can safely present to the end user everything present in the feed. The consumer could use the start/end information to determine if this is a past, ongoing or future alert and adjust the presentation accordingly. [from GBFS]
