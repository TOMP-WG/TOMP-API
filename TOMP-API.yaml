    description: gives information about transport asset availability and pricing [free_bike_status and system_pricing_plans in GBFS].<p> The endpoints in this part can give information about the availability of assets (or typeOfAssets) and can provide information to take the next step - the booking part.

    description: a booking is the main object exchanged between MaaS and a TO [from MaaS-API]. <br>See also <a href='https://github.com/maasglobal/maas-tsp-api/blob/master/specs/Booking.md'>Booking.md</a><p>This section contains functionality to book a leg (part of a trip) for one asset (or typeOfAsset), including the non-happy paths (cancel, expire etc).

  - name: booking [optional]
    description: endpoints that can faciliate processes in the booking process, but are not necessary for a minimal viable product. You can think of getting information, updating (parts of) a booking (not the state!), adding and removing subscriptions (webhook), etc.

  - name: trip execution
    description: supports the complete trip execution process. It contains f.i. getting an available asset, assigning the asset to the leg, starting, pausing, finishing a leg (all by using the POST /legs/{id}/events) or updating a leg (not the state!).

        During the routing phase this service can be used to check availability without any state changes. <p>In the final check, just before presenting the alternatives to the user, a call should be made using `provideIds`, requesting the TO to provide unique IDs to reference to during communication with the MP.

      description: This endpoint **must** be used to alter the state of a booking:<br>- The operation 'CANCEL' Cancels the booking (see <4> in the process flow - booking), <br>- the operation 'EXPIRE' informs that the booking-option is expired (seel <5> in the process flow - booking) and <br>- the 'COMMIT' actually makes this booking option a real confirmed booking. (see also (3.2) in process flow - booking). This event should also be used to commit in the 'postponed-commit' scenario.<br> - 'DENY' tells the MP that the leg is cancelled in the post-commit scenario. <p> `CANCEL` - Cancels a confirmed booking. Cancelling twice should still return 204. <br> `EXPIRE` - Typically for sending back a signal from TO to MP to tell the pending state is expired. Expiring twide should return 204. Expiring a booking in a non-pending state will result in 403. <BR> `COMMIT` - Turns the booking in a confirmed state, after all legs are in state pending. Committing twice will result in 204. If the booking is in state CANCELLED or EXPIRED, a commit will result a 403. <BR> `DENY` - Used for the 'postponed-commit' scenario. Whenever a TO cannot give garantees directly to fullfil a booking, it can return a 'COMMIT', but the state of the booking object should be 'POSTPONED-COMMIT'. In the conditions returned in the planning phase is stated until when this phase can be. After this time it will be come expired. Otherwise it can be commmitted when the leg is confirmed or denied (using this event).

This file is an array of alert objects defined as below. Obsolete alerts should be removed so the client application can safely present to the end user everything present in the feed.
