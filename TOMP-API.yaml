    description: a booking is the main object exchanged between MaaS and a TO [from MaaS-API]. <br>See also <a href='https://github.com/maasglobal/maas-tsp-api/blob/master/specs/Booking.md'>Booking.md</a><p>This section contains functionality to book a leg (part of a trip) for one asset (or assetType), including the non-happy paths (cancel, expire etc).

  - name: booking [optional]
    description: endpoints that can faciliate processes in the booking process, but are not necessary for a minimal viable product. You can think of getting information, updating (parts of) a booking (not the state!), adding and removing subscriptions (webhook), etc.

  - name: trip execution
    description: supports the complete trip execution process. It contains f.i. getting an available asset, assigning the asset to the leg, starting, pausing, finishing a leg (all by using the POST /legs/{id}/events) or updating an execution (not the state!).

(see also (3.2) in process flow - booking). This event should also be used to commit in the 'postponed-commit' scenario.<br> - 'DENY' tells the MP that the leg is cancelled in the post-commit scenario. <p> `CANCEL` - Cancels a confirmed booking. Cancelling twice should still return 204. <br> `EXPIRE` - Typically for sending back a signal from TO to MP to tell the pending state is expired. Expiring twide should return 204. Expiring a booking in a non-pending state will result in 403. <BR> `COMMIT` - Turns the booking in a confirmed state, after all legs are in state pending. Committing twice will result in 204. If the booking is in state CANCELLED or EXPIRED, a commit will result a 403. <BR> `DENY` - Used for the 'postponed-commit' scenario. Whenever a TO cannot give garantees directly to fullfil a booking, it can return a 'COMMIT', but the state of the booking object should be 'POSTPONED-COMMIT'. In the conditions returned in the planning phase is stated until when this phase can be. After this time it will be come expired. Otherwise it can be commmitted when the leg is confirmed or denied (using this event).

For example, system closures due to weather would be listed here, but a system that only operated for part of the year would have that schedule listed in the system-calendar.json feed. This file is an array of alert objects defined as below. Obsolete alerts should be removed so the client application can safely present to the end user everything present in the feed. The consumer could use the start/end information to determine if this is a past, ongoing or future alert and adjust the presentation accordingly. [from GBFS]

      description: this describes a part of the fare (or discount). It contains a for instance the startup costs (fixed) or the flex part (e.g. 1.25 EUR per 2.0 MILES). The amount is tax included. In case of discounts, the values are negative. With 'MAX' you can specify e.g. a maximum of 15 euro per day. Percentage is mainly added for discounts. The `scale` properties create the ability to communicate scales (e.g. the first 4 kilometers you've to pay EUR 0.35 per kilometer, the kilometers 4 until 8 EUR 0.50 and above it EUR 0.80 per kilometer).
