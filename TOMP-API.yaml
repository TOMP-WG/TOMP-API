    description: gives information about transport asset availability and pricing [free_bike_status and system_pricing_plans in GBFS].<p> The endpoints in this part can give information about the availability of assets (or assetTypes) and can provide information to take the next step - the booking part.

    description: a booking is the main object exchanged between MaaS and a TO [from MaaS-API]. <br>See also <a href='https://github.com/maasglobal/maas-tsp-api/blob/master/specs/Booking.md'>Booking.md</a><p>This section contains functionality to book a leg (part of a trip) for one asset (or assetType), including the non-happy paths (cancel, expire etc).

  - name: trip execution
    description: supports the complete trip execution process. It contains f.i. getting an available asset, assigning the asset to the leg, starting, pausing, finishing a leg (all by using the POST /legs/{id}/events) or updating an execution (not the state!).

        <p>The MP can implement this endpoint when it allows direct booking by TOs. The specific TO can book an asset from themselves to get it registrated and handled (financially) by the MP.

Whenever a TO cannot give guarantees directly to fulfil a booking, it can return a 'COMMIT', but the state of the booking object should be 'POSTPONED-COMMIT'. In the conditions returned in the planning phase is stated until when this phase can be. After this time it will become expired. Otherwise, it can be committed when the leg is confirmed or denied (using this event).

For example, system closures due to weather would be listed here, but a system that only operated for part of the year would have that schedule listed in the system-calendar.json feed. This file is an array of alert objects defined as below. Obsolete alerts should be removed so the client application can safely present to the end user everything present in the feed. The consumer could use the start/end information to determine if this is a past, ongoing or future alert and adjust the presentation accordingly. [from GBFS]
