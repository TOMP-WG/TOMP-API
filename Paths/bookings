      description: Creates a new `Booking` for the TSP in **booked** state. The returned
        object will be a reference that is passed back & forth throughout the
        booking life cycle.
        The Booking may be modified in the response, e.g. location being
        adjusted for a more suitable pick-up location.
        In addition, the service may contain a **meta** attribute for arbitrary
        TSP metadata that the TSP needs later, and **token** attribute depicting
        how long the current state is valid.
