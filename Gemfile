# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve

#gem "jekyll", "~> 3.9"

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.

gem "jekyll-remote-theme"

#gem "minima"
#gem "jekyll-theme-cayman"
#gem "bulma-clean-theme"


# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.

gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-analytics"
  gem "jekyll-feed"
  gem "jekyll-sitemap"
